# MyToken

A simple solidity contract that enables minting and burning of a token

## Description

This is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has  two functions. A `Mint` function that mints a quantity of tokens named CRYPTO (CRY) and a `burn` function which destroys a quantity of these tokens. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

## Getting Started

You can use this contract by using remix, https://remix.ethereum.org/ creating a file with a .sol extension and copying the contents of the MyToken.sol file
Compile and run the contract and interact with it by 'mint'ing and 'burn'ing. You can aslo get the token name, abbreviation and total supply

### Executing program

You can change the token name and abbreviation by updating the following lines
```js
    string public tokenName = "CRYPTO";
    string public tokenAbbrv = "CRY";
```
